<h2>Software</h2>
<strong>Computer software</strong>, or simply <u>software</u>, is a part of a computer system that consists of data or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.
<br>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank" title="computer science wikipedia">computer science</a> and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data.
<br>Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.</body></html>
