The way to be <strong><u><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680011" target="-_blank" title="rich dad poor dad amazon">rich</a></u></strong>: <br><br>What The Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!<p style="margin-top:40px;">Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad - the international runaway bestseller that has held a top spot on the New York Times bestsellers list for over six years - is an investor, entrepreneur and educator whose perspectives on money and investing fly in the face of conventional wisdom. He has, virtually single-handedly, challenged and changed the way tens of millions, around the world, think about money.</p> <p><img src="seoul.jpg" width="300px"></p>
In communicating his point of view on why 'old' advice - get a good job, save money, get out of debt,
invest for the long term, and diversify - is 'bad' (both obsolete and flawed) advice, Robert has earned a
reputation for straight talk, irreverence and courage.</body>
